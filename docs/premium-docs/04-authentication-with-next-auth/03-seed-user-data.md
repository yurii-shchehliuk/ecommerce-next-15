# Seed User Data

Let's add a couple sample users to the database.

#### Install `bcrypt-ts-edge`

If you look at the sample data, the passwords are being hashed. We are going to use the `bcrypt-ts-edge` package. It is a TypeScript-native implementation of bcrypt, designed for edge environments such as Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, or any serverless platforms that donâ€™t support native Node.js APIs. You could just as well install and use the `bcryptjs` package, but we're going to use this for easy deployment later.

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
npm install bcrypt-ts-edge
```

Open the `db/sample-data.ts` file and add the following code:

```typescript
import { hashSync } from 'bcrypt-ts-edge'; // Import the hashSync function from the bcrypt-ts-edge library

const sampleData = {
  users: [
    {
      name: 'John',
      email: 'admin@example.com',
      password: hashSync('123456', 10),
      role: 'admin',
    },
    {
      name: 'Jane',
      email: 'jane@example.com',
      password: hashSync('123456', 10),
      role: 'user',
    },
  ],

  products: [
    //...
  ],
};
```

## Update the Seeder

Open the `db/seed.ts` file and update it with the following code:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import sampleData from '@/db/sample-data';

async function main() {
  const prisma = new PrismaClient();
  await prisma.product.deleteMany();
  await prisma.account.deleteMany();
  await prisma.session.deleteMany();
  await prisma.verificationToken.deleteMany();
  await prisma.user.deleteMany();

  await prisma.product.createMany({ data: sampleData.products });
  await prisma.user.createMany({ data: sampleData.users });

  console.log('Database seeded successfully');
}

main();
```

Now, in addition to the products, we are also seeding the users.

Open Prisma Studio and look at the User table. You should see the two users we just seeded.
