# Section Intro

In this section we're going to get started with the Prostore app. We'll set up Next.js 15 with the Create Next App tool and initialize the ShadCN UI library and I'll show you how that works as far as importing specific components and so on. We'll also go over file-based routing and some of the Next.js basics. We'll create our layout and talk about groups. We're going start on the header component. This will change throughout the course as we add to it. We'll also create the footer component, which is really simple.

We're going to have a light and dark mode toggle using the `next-themes` package. So we'll get that set up. We'll setup the loading and not-found pages. The responsive sheet menu which slides in on small screens. We're also going to start on the product display using some sample data from a TypeScript file. Then later on, we'll replace that with a real database. We'll finish up the section with some nice looking homepage components. One to show some bullet points with some common ecommerce website features like 30 day money back, etc. We'll also have a product promotion component with a countdown timer like you see on many websites that sell products.
