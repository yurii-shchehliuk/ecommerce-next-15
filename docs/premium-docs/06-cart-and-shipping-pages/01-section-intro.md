# Cart & Shipping Pages

Now that we can add and remove items from the cart, we'll start the process of checkout. We're going to work on two of the four pages for checkout in this section. That is the cart page with the table as well as the shipping address page, which will allow the user to enter their shipping information.

We'll start by creating the cart page that will show all the items in the user's cart. 

Then we'll get started on the table of items. We will use the ShadCN table component for that. 

We're also going to need to format our currency, so we'll create a utility function to handle that.

Then we'll start on the shipping address page, which will be the next step in the checkout process. 

We'll add the form to add the user's address. 

Then we'll handle the submission with an action. Once the address is filled in, we'll use that address for that user to automatically fill in the fields when they order more products.

Lastly, we'll create a checkout steps component to show where in the proccess the user is.
