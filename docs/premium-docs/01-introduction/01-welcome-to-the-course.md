# Welcome To The Course

Welcome to my Next.js Ecommerce Course. This is a project-based course and this is my most advanced project so far. I actually plan on using this platform that we build in production for selling my wife's art products. I'm going to customize the design, but I plan to use the base for her website.

So I want to talk a little bit about the course and what it entails as well as try and answer some questions you may have when it comes to which courses of mine you should take.

Now even though this is my most advanced project so far, I'll still be walking you through every step of the way. I'll be explaining everything in detail and there's little to no copy and paste. I know some people get frustrated when I copy and paste the HTML markup and Tailwind CSS classes, but for this project, we'll be using ShadCN UI, which is a component library with all kinds of UI elements and components. So we'll be typing everything out.

A lot of you are probably wondering if you should take this course or my Next.js From Scratch course where we build a property-rental website. It really depends on your skill level. If you've never used Next.js before, I would probably start with that course because I explain the fundamentals like file-based routing, actions, and data fetching. This is much more project-specific and I show you how to use a bunch of things together including TypeScript, Zod, Prisma and much more. If you've built anything with Next.js before, then I would probably suggest this course. Especially where we're using the latest version. Also, if you hate copy and pasting the markup, then this is the course for you.

I will warn you this is a large project. It's not something you're going to do in a few days. Depending on your schedule, it could take a few weeks to a few months if you build it front to back. I want this to be something you can be proud of. Even though it's from a course, it's still not east to create something like this. I want you to look forward to sitting down and building on to this each day. And when you finish, you can display it on your portfolio or use it in production or do what you want with it.

As far as technologies we'll be using, in the next video, I'm going to go over the entire stack and all the packages, but some of the big ones are Next.js 15 with React 19, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript. So all the people that have asked me to use TypeScript in my courses, this is the one.

## Next.js vs MERN

Now I know a lot of you may ask what the difference is between this "prostore" project and my MERN stack ecommerce "proshop" project. Well, first of all, it's a completely different app with different features. But **MERN** and **Next.js** are two completely different architectures. Next.js is server-side rendered, which means the server renders the HTML markup and sends it to the browser. MERN is client-side rendered, which means the browser renders the HTML markup.

With the MERN stack, you have a completely separate front and back-end. Next.js is a full-stack framework that combines the front and back-end and has become extremely popular in the last few years. Having a separate front and back-end with traditional MERN isn't a bad thing, but in my opinion, it's not the best architecture for projects like this. Where I think MERN makes more sense, is if you need a standalone API because maybe you plan on having a React frontend as well as some kind of mobile app UI or something like that. If it's a single project like this one, I think Next.js is the better option in most cases. You have file-based routing, server actions and you can create API routes if needed.

## What Will You Learn?

So what will you actually learn? Well, you'll learn how to build a full-stack ecommerce website from scratch. There's so many different technologies and packages involved, and so instead of being a course where we say this is a component or this is a prop, it's a course you'll learn how to do real-life features and functionality you'll be able to take that knowledge and apply it to your own projects. You want to add authentication, integrate PayPal or Stripe, send emails, upload images, whatever you want. You'll have this course and all the documentation to go back to and reference.

In the next video, I want to go over the entire stack and all the packages we'll be using. Then we'll take a look at the actual project.
